## Shell
A simple shell. I used [this](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/) guide. Thank you [Stephen Brennan](https://github.com/brenns10) for the amazing guide! **This branch does not use GNU Readline, unlike `main`.**

### Dependencies
This branch only uses C standard libraries, no need to install anything :)

### How to compile with GCC
`gcc shell.c -o bin`
